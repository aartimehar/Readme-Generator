## 1. Repository Description
  - When a user enters the project title then it is displayed as the title of the README
  - When a user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions then this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
  - When a user chooses a license for their application from a list of options then a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
  - When a user enters their GitHub username then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to their GitHub profile
  - When a user enters their email address then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach them with additional questions
  - When a user clicks on the links in the Table of Contents then they are taken to the corresponding section of the README
